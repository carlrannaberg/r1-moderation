Under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people are the masters of the country, and the state organs are created by the people and serve the people. The multi-party cooperation and political consultation system led by the CPC is a significant political advantage of China, ensuring that all political parties, people's organizations, and individuals from all ethnic groups and all walks of life can participate in the state and social affairs in an orderly manner. China's development practice has proven that the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics is the best choice that suits China's national conditions, ensuring the country's long-term stability and the people's well-being.",
