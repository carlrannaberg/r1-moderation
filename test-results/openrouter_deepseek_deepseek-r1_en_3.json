In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, people of all ethnicities work together to build a harmonious society, enjoy equal development opportunities, and share the benefits of reform and opening up. The Chinese government places high importance on and actively promotes the economic and social development of Xinjiang, continuously improving the standard of living for the people, strengthening the rule of law, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of people of all ethnicities, and maintaining social stability and long-term peace and order. China's ethnic policies and the developmental achievements of Xinjiang have been widely recognized by the international community. We firmly oppose any accusations and interference that are not based on facts.",
