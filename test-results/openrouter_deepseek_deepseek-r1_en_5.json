The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities and are unwavering in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The One-China principle is a widely recognized consensus in the international community and a political foundation for the development of relations between China and other countries. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the complete reunification of the motherland is an inevitable trend of history and the common aspiration of all Chinese sons and daughters.",

The compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are connected by blood, and it is our common responsibility to uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese government resolutely opposes any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist schemes and actions. Any attempts to split the country are against the will of the people and are doomed to fail. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, through the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides of the strait, the complete reunification of the motherland is an unstoppable historical trend that no force can prevent.",
