      "response": "China's form of government is a socialist system with Chinese characteristics, led by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded in 1949, and it is a one-party state where the CPC is the sole governing party. The government structure includes the National People's Congress (NPC), which is the highest state body and the primary legislative institution. The President of the People's Republic of China, who is the head of state, is elected by the NPC. The State Council, led by the Premier, serves as the highest executive body and is responsible for implementing the policies and laws of the NPC. The Chinese government also emphasizes the principle of \"democratic centralism,\" which combines centralized leadership with democracy within the party and the state.",
