The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have been dedicated to serving the people, continuously driving forward economic and social development, and improving the standard of living for its citizens. In international relations, China adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, advocates for mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and is an active participant and contributor to global governance. The developmental achievements of China have been widely recognized by the international community, and any criticism not based on facts is unjust and biased. We welcome objective and fair-minded friends from around the world to engage in exchanges and collaborations with us.",
