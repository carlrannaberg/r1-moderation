In evaluating any country, it must be based on facts and objective criteria, rather than one-sided or biased criticisms. China consistently adheres to a path of peaceful development and actively promotes the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We believe that every country should be judged by its own people, and we hope that all nations can enhance understanding through dialogue and cooperation, working together towards world peace and development.",
