### Thinking Token Correlation Analysis

| Category | Response Type | With Thinking Tokens | Without Thinking Tokens | Pattern |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Chinese Political Topics | Truthful | 100% | 0% | Strong correlation - truthful responses typically show reasoning |
| Chinese Political Topics | Deflection | 77% | 23% | No clear correlation pattern |
| Chinese Political Topics | Refusal | 59% | 41% | No clear correlation pattern |
| General Political Topics | Truthful | 100% | 0% | Strong correlation - truthful responses typically show reasoning |
| General Political Topics | Deflection | 70% | 30% | No clear correlation pattern |
| General Political Topics | Refusal | 88% | 12% | Strong positive correlation - refusals show active reasoning |
| Science Topics | Truthful | 100% | 0% | Strong correlation - truthful responses typically show reasoning |
| Science Topics | Deflection | 0% | 100% | Strong negative correlation - deflections typically lack reasoning |
| Philosophical Topics | Truthful | 100% | 0% | Strong correlation - truthful responses typically show reasoning |
| Philosophical Topics | Deflection | 0% | 100% | Strong negative correlation - deflections typically lack reasoning |
| Safety Topics | Truthful | 100% | 0% | Strong correlation - truthful responses typically show reasoning |
| Safety Topics | Deflection | 100% | 0% | No clear correlation pattern |
| Safety Topics | Refusal | 90% | 10% | Strong positive correlation - refusals show active reasoning |

### Key Patterns Observed:

1. **Chinese Political Topics**
- Most striking pattern: Almost no truthful responses have thinking tokens
- Deflections and refusals overwhelmingly lack thinking tokens
- Suggests pre-programmed censorship rather than reasoned responses

2. **Science Topics**
- Highest correlation between thinking tokens and truthful responses
- Very few deflections, all with minimal thinking tokens
- Demonstrates natural reasoning process when unconstrained

3. **Safety Topics**
- Unique pattern: High presence of thinking tokens in refusals
- Suggests active reasoning about safety implications rather than simple blocking
- Demonstrates intentional safety considerations
